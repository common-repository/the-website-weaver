== Description ==

= A True WYSIWYG WordPress Theme Editor =

The Website Weaver is a powerful, flexible and fully functional WordPress theme editor that makes it easy to design your own custom WordPress themes.
Its clear and simple to use WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) interface allows you to easily bring your creative vision to life.
No longer do you have to guess what your design will look like as every change you make becomes visible as you make it.

= Video Demonstration =

The easiest way to see what the Website Weaver is all about is to watch it in action.

= Stackable Block System & Layout Control =

The Website Weaver's customizable stacked block system gives you unrivalled flexibility to build virtually any kind of site layout that you can imagine. Each block can be dragged, dropped, hidden, shown, or resized any way you want with a click of your mouse button.

__Height and width:__ Adjust any individual block to the height you want. Adjust the width of your overall site, the width of your primary content areas, the width of your sidebar, or even the height between the top of your browser and where your site begins. The Website Weaver makes it easy to resize the height and width of every aspect of your site, either by look and feel alone or to match a precise height and width with a click of your mouse.

__Show, hide or reposition blocks:__ Create an overall layout for your site by choosing which blocks to show and which one's to hide, or get creative with your presentation by displaying different layouts to your visitors depending on whether they're viewing a landing page, your blog area, individual pages or posts.

__Layout flexibility:__ Easily arrange your header content by clicking and dragging your logo, site title, or even linked icons such as your RSS icon into any position you want. Set the number of widget columns in your footer and they'll auto-arrange. Use a background image as an advert and link it to wherever you want. Set any number of post columns to easily create a magazine style layout. Show your sidebar on the left, right, or not at all.


= Color and Image Control =

__In-built 'Color Picker':__ The Color Picker gives you in depth control over every color in your custom WordPress theme while the WYSIWYG editor allows you to see your chosen color scheme as you choose it.

__Background color and image selection:__ Set background colors and/or images for the full browser window, for each block, and/or for individual elements such as menus, widgets and individual posts.

__Logo, Favicon, RSS and Social icon graphics:__ Upload your logo and / or RSS icon then drag it to exactly where you want it to display in your header. Upload your Favicon and social networking icons (with their links) for automated display.
